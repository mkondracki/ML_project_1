# ML Project 1

**The code included in this repository applies machine learning models to real data for classification purposes.**

*implementations.py*\
Provides all the necessary functions for performing various linear models, starting from the implementation of  GD, SGD, Least Squares, Ridge Regression, Logistic Regression, as well as Regular Logisti Reggresion. In addition, several helpful functions are included to improve the performance of these models.

*Function.py*\
It's an adjunct script that includes all the auxiliary functions required for cleaning the data and pre-processing them. Contains cross validation functionality as well as additional functions for determining best parameters.

*helpers.py*\
Consists of the essential functions for loading the data.

*projectML_.ipynb*\
The notebook with all the tests

*run.py*\
The run file leading to the best results

*Dataset*:\
Using the path "\Data\train.csv", Python notebook assumed that the datasets train.csv and test.csv are placed in the "/Data" folder.
